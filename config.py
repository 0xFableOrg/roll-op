# Summary on default port mapping:
#
# The default port mapping uses the same port as the devnet configuration in the Optimism monorepo,
# whenever possible.
#
# - L1 http RPC: 8545
# - L1 WebSocket RPC: 8546
# - L1 authRPC: 8551 (authenticated APIs)
# - L1 p2p: 30303 (block & tx gossip — geth default, not configured in devnet)
# - L1 metrics: 7060
# - L2 engine http RPC: 9545 (like L1 http RPC but for L2)
# - L2 engine Websocket RPC: 9546 (like L1 Websocket RPC but for L2)
# - L2 engine authRPC: 9551 (like L1 authRPC but for L2 — op-node <> engine communication)
# - L2 engine p2p: 30313 (like L1 p2p but for L2 — not configured in devnet)
# - L2 engine metrics: 8060
# - L2 node RPC: 7545 (optimism_ and admin_ namespaces)
# - L2 node metrics: 7300
# - L2 proposer RPC: 5545 (no namespaces)
# - L2 proposer metrics: 7302
# - L2 batcher RPC: 6545 (admin_ namespace)
# - L2 batcher metrics: 7301

# When following the OP stack "Getting Started" guide, the following ports are used:
# (The L1 and L2 engine ports are inverted, and the other components are numbered differently.)
# https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/getting-started
#
# - L1 http RPC: 9545
# - L1 WebSocket RPC: 9546
# - L1 authRPC: 9551 (authenticated APIs)
# - L1 p2p: 30313 (block & tx gossip)
# - L2 engine http RPC: 8545
# - L2 engine Websocket RPC: 8546 (like L1 Websocket RPC but for L2)
# - L2 engine authRPC: 8551
# - L2 engine p2p: 9003
# - L2 node RPC: 8547
# - L2 proposer RPC: 8560 (no namespaces)
# - L2 batcher RPC: 8548 (admin_ namespace)
#
# The guide does not configure metrics, so the defaults from above are used.
####################################################################################################
# NOTE
#
# The default config is a DEVNET config, which makes it suitable for testing, but not production.
# It is based on the config from the Optimism monorepo devnet as far as the tuning parameters and
# the port mappings are concerned.
#
# We provide various ways to customize it via the following methods:
# - `use_production_config()` — a configurable more suitable for production environment
# - `use_devnet_config()` — same config as the Optimism monorepo devnet
#   (in practice, just changes some paths)
# - `use_doc_config()` — same config as the OP Stack "Getting Started" guide
#
# The `production` config is inspired by the `doc` config for the performance parameters, but uses
# the port mappings, paths, etc... from the default config.
#
# The `production` config is automatically enabled when using the `--preset=prod` flag, otherwise
# the default config is used.
