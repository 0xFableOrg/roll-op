This modules contains classes defining "writeable streams", which implement the `write(text)` and
`flush()` methods, as well as `close()` and `closed` (though those do not seem required), making
them usable in place of file descriptors for functions such as subprocess.Popen, or assignable to
`sys.stdout`.

    the same offset a before, leading a file starting with a nul prelude.)

    will be truncated when re-opened (which is relevant in case the old file was deleted or moved
