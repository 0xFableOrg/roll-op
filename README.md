# roll-op

Under development!

This work is support by an
[Optimism governance grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals?id=a6e6bfb8-75bd-41bd-acb1-618c3c62e667).

roll-op (formerly simple-op-stack-rollup) is an open-source script that makes it trivial for any
developer to spin up an OP stack rollup, both for development and production use.

The script enables you to configure and run your own rollup infrastructure by running only two or
three commands. It uses a single well-documented configuration file.

Additionally, the package supports spinning a block explorer (Blockscout), and EIP-4337 account
abstraction infrastructure (a bundler and a paymaster).

## Versioning

The current version of simple-op-stack-rollup deploys software pinned to the following releases:

- Optimism Monorepo: [`op-node/v1.3.1 `](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.3.1) (+ [a few patches](setup.py))
- op-geth: [`v1.101304.1`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/tag/v1.101304.1)

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10 (to run the `roll.py` script) with pip
  - `sudo apt install python3-pip` on Debian-based systems
  - `brew install python` on macOS with Homebrew

You also need the following installed, `rollop` will warn you if these are missing:

- Some common command line utilities: `make`, `curl`, `tar`, `awk` and `grep`.
- [`logrotate`](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate)
  - `sudo apt install logrotate` on Debian-based systems
  - `brew install logrotate` on macOS with Homebrew
- Git
- Docker (if you wish to run the Blockscout block explorer)

`rollop` will check the following dependencies and install them for you if needed (the script will
always ask for your permission before installing anything outside the current directory):

- Python libraries
  - [Tomli](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/)
  - [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) (for block explorer support)
  - These will be installed globally by default. To install them locally instead (in a venv within
    the roll-op directory), you can run `source devenv.sh` before running `rollbop`.
- Node.js 20.9.0
- pnpm (`pnpm install -g pnpm`)
- Yarn (for account abstraction support)
  (`npm install -g yarn` — the old one, not yarn v3 aka yarn berry)
- Geth >= 1.13.4 (but only if you want to run a devnet L1 node)
- The `jq` command line utility
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- Go >= 1.21

## Usage

```
usage: rollop [-h] [--name NAME] [--preset {dev,prod}] [--config CONFIG_PATH] [--clean] [--no-ansi-esc] [--yes] <command> ...

Helps you spin up an op-stack rollup.
Use `rollop <command> --help` to get more detailed help for a command.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --name NAME           name of the rollup deployment
  --preset {dev,prod}   use a preset rollup configuration
  --config CONFIG_PATH  path to the config file
  --clean               clean command-related output before running the specified command
  --no-ansi-esc         disable ANSI escape codes for terminal manipulation
  --yes                 answer yes to all prompts (install all requested dependencies)

commands:
  <command>
    
    -- MAIN COMMANDS --

    help                show this help message and exit
    setup               installs prerequisites and builds the optimism repository
    devnet              starts a local devnet, comprising an L1 node and all L2 components
    clean               cleans up deployment outputs and databases
    l2                  starts an L2 blockchain, deploying the contracts if needed
    aa                  starts an ERC-4337 bundler and a paymaster signer service
    explorer            starts a block explorer
    
    -- GRANULAR COMMANDS --

    l1                  starts a local L1 node
    deploy-l2           deploys but does not start an L2 chain
    l2-engine           starts a local L2 execution engine (op-geth) node
    l2-sequencer        starts a local L2 node (op-node) in sequencer mode
    l2-batcher          starts a local L2 transaction batcher
    l2-proposer         starts a local L2 output roots proposer
    
    -- CLEANUP --

    clean-build         cleans up build outputs (but not deployment outputs)
    clean-l2            cleans up L2 deployment outputs
    clean-aa            cleans up deployment outputs for account abstraction
    clean-explorer      deletes the block explorer databases, logs, and containers
```

You can also use the `roll.py` script directly as `./roll.py` or `python3 roll.py`  as an
alternative. However `rollop` is recommended, as it will guarantee it is run from the rollop
repository and can be symlinked if required.

IMPORTANT: The block explorer is not currently scoped to deployments — so it can only run for a
deployment at a time from a `roll-op` repository. When switching between deployments or even
redeploying within the same deployment, you must clean the explorer with `rollop clean-explorer` or
`rollop explorer --clean`.

### Examples

```bash
./rollop setup
./rollop setup --yes # auto-install all dependencies
./rollop --clean devnet # default deployment name is "rollup"

# equivalent with a different deployment name
./rollop --clean --name=testing --preset=dev --config=config.toml.example devnet

# to deploy & run on an existing L1 (after setting up a config.toml)
./rollop --clean --name=my-prod-rollup --preset=prod --config=config.toml l2

# resume previously create rollup (e.g. after killing previous command)
./rollop --name=my-prod-rollup --preset=prod --config=config.toml l2

# deploy rollup on existing L1, then start it later
./rollop --name=my-prod-rollup --preset=prod --config=config.toml deploy-l2
./rollop --name=my-prod-rollup --preset=prod --config=config.toml l2

# start block explorer (blockscout) for a running rollup
./rollop explorer --config=config.toml
```

In the dev preset, you can use the following cast command to generate a simple transfer transaction:
```
cast send \
  --from 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --private-key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:9545 \
  --value 1ether \
  0x3fAB184622Dc19b6109349B94811493BF2a45362
```

## Debugging

If you have an issue with your network, please inspect the following files to find out about
the actual configuration that the rollup runs with:

- `deployments/NAME/logs/l1_commands.log`
- `deployments/NAME/logs/l2_commands.log`
- `deployments/NAME/artifacts/deploy-config.json`
- `deployments/NAME/artifacts/rollup-config.json`
