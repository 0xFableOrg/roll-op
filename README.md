# simple-op-stack-rollup

Under development!

simple-op-stack rollup is open-source package that makes it trivial for any
developer to spin up an OP stack rollup, both for development and production
use.

The package enables you to configure and run your own rollup infrastructure by
running only two or three commands. It uses a single well-documented
configuration file, and helps you fill it via a command line wizard.

Additionally, the package supports spinning EIP-4337 account abstraction
infrastructure (a bundler and a paymaster) and helps you configure them so that
you can automatically subsidize gas for transactions that match certain criteria
(e.g. transactions to specific whitelisted contracts).
