# simple-op-stack-rollup

Under development!

This work is support by an
[Optimism governance grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals?id=a6e6bfb8-75bd-41bd-acb1-618c3c62e667).

simple-op-stack rollup is open-source package that makes it trivial for any
developer to spin up an OP stack rollup, both for development and production
use.

The package enables you to configure and run your own rollup infrastructure by
running only two or three commands. It uses a single well-documented
configuration file, and helps you fill it via a command line wizard.

Additionally, the package supports spinning EIP-4337 account abstraction
infrastructure (a bundler and a paymaster) and helps you configure them so that
you can automatically subsidize gas for transactions that match certain criteria
(e.g. transactions to specific whitelisted contracts).

## Versioning

The current version of simple-op-stack-rollup deploys software pinned to the following commit

- Optimism Monorepo: [`7168db67c5b421975fef2a090aa6e6ee4e3ff298`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/7168db67c5b421975fef2a090aa6e6ee4e3ff298)
- op-geth: [`v1.101106.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/tree/v1.101106.0)

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10 (to run the `roll.py` script)

The following dependencies will be checked by `roll.py`:

- Some common command line utilities: `make`, `curl`, `tar`, `awk` and `grep`.
- Git

`roll.py` will check the following dependencies and install them for you if needed (the script will
always for your permission before installing anything outside the current directory):

- [Tomli Python Lib](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/)
    - Will be installed globally if you don't run the script in a venv.
    - You can install locally (in a venv within the roll-op directory) by running
      `source scripts/install.sh` before running `roll.py`.
- Node.js 16.x
- Yarn (`npm install -g yarn` â€” the old one, not yarn v3 aka yarn berry)
- Geth >= 1.12.0 (but only if you want to run a devnet L1 node)
- The `jq` command line utility
- Foundry
- Go >= 1.19

## Usage

```
./roll.py [-h] [--name NAME] [--preset {dev,prod}] [--config CONFIG_PATH] [--clean]
               [--stack-trace] [--no-ansi-esc]
               <command> ...

Helps you spin up an op-stack rollup.
Use `./roll.py <command> --help` to get more detailed help for a command.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --name NAME           name of the rollup deployment
  --preset {dev,prod}   use a preset rollup configuration
  --config CONFIG_PATH  path to the config file
  --clean               run the 'clean' command before running the specified command
  --stack-trace         display exception stack trace in case of failure
  --no-ansi-esc         disable ANSI escape codes for terminal manipulation

commands:
  <command>
    
    -- MAIN COMMANDS --

    help                show this help message and exit
    setup               installs prerequisites and builds the optimism repository
    devnet              starts a local devnet, comprising an L1 node and all L2 components
    clean               cleans up deployment outputs and databases
    l2                  deploys and starts a local L2 blockchain
    
    -- GRANULAR COMMANDS --

    l1                  starts a local L1 node
    deploy-l2           deploys but does not start an L2 chain
    start-l2            start all components of the rollup system (see below)
    l2-engine           starts a local L2 execution engine (op-geth) node
    l2-sequencer        starts a local L2 node (op-node) in sequencer mode
    l2-batcher          starts a local L2 transaction batcher
    l2-proposer         starts a local L2 output roots proposer
    
    -- CLEANUP --

    clean-build         cleans up build outputs (but not deployment outputs or databases)
    clean-l1            cleans up deployment outputs & databases for L1
    clean-l2            cleans up deployment outputs & databases for L2

```

You can also use the `rollop` script as an alternative to `roll.py` (you can also symlink it into
you `PATH`) and it will work.

### Examples

```bash
./roll.py setup
./roll.py setup --yes # auto-install all dependencies
./roll.py --clean devnet

# equivalent with a different deployment name
./roll.py --clean --name=testing --preset=dev --config=config.toml.example devnet

# to deploy & run on an existing L1 (after setting up a config.toml)
./roll.py --clean --name=my-prod-rollup --preset=prod --config=config.toml l2

# resume previously create rollup (e.g. after killing previous command)
./roll.py --name=my-prod-rollup preset=prod --config=config.toml start-l2

# deploy rollup on existing L1, then start it
./roll.py --name=my-prod-rollup preset=prod --config=config.toml deploy-l2
./roll.py --name=my-prod-rollup preset=prod --config=config.toml start-l2
```

## Contributing (for developers building simple-op-stack rollup)

```bash
# Enable dev environment and make sure dev dependencies are installed
source devenv.sh

# ... do stuff

# Run lint & format checks
make check

# Fix issues highlighted by make check if possible (some lint issues might need manual fixes)
make fix && make check


```
